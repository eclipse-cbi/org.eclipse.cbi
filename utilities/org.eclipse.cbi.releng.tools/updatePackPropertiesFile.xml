  A ant script, which adds or updates the pack.properties file
  in a zip file, so that jar signer will know to skip files
  that are already signed.

  Note: the Java code that determines if "signed or not" uses
  a very simple heuristic to determine if signed or not. It simply
  lookes for the presence of files such as "ECLIPSE_.SF".
  
  Usage: 
    ant -f updatePackPropertiesFile.xml -DarchiveFile=<path of zip file>
